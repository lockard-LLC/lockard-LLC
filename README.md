## About

I founded **Lockard LLC** as both a declaration and a blueprint — proof that technology, when rooted in empathy and lived experience, can become a force for dignity and stability.  
For me, this isn't a theory. It's survival turned into strategy.

After surviving thirteen years of domestic violence, addiction, and systemic neglect, I made a promise: if I ever reached safety, I would build systems that helped others do the same.  
**Lockard LLC** is the fulfillment of that promise — a hybrid technology company that bridges advocacy, design, and data integrity to help survivors rebuild their lives with structure and compassion.

I registered the company in Kentucky on July 4, 2025 — intentionally on Independence Day. That date represents more than incorporation; it marks my own freedom.  
The company operates from Lexington, KY, where I began rebuilding after escaping abuse, recovering from HIV-related complications, and completing my degree at Eastern Kentucky University. Every pillar of Lockard LLC stands on the same foundation that carried me through those years: resilience, clarity, and a refusal to let cruelty define my story.

**Lockard LLC** serves as an umbrella organization that develops and incubates specialized companies and projects, each bringing empathy, structure, and transparency to systems that too often fail those they're meant to protect.  
Our work blends **social innovation**, **human-centered design**, and **ethical engineering** to build technology that restores trust — not just efficiency.

**Our mission:** Transform lived experience into infrastructure for dignity through purpose-built companies and projects.

## Mission & Vision

**Mission:**  
To build and incubate technology companies that survivors of crisis can trust — trauma-informed, transparent, and designed to empower recovery, not just interrupt harm.

**Vision:**  
A world where no one faces trauma, legal systems, or recovery alone — where digital infrastructure becomes a bridge to connection, safety, and renewal through purpose-built companies and projects.

---

## How We Operate

**Lockard LLC** runs as a hybrid social enterprise — a for-profit LLC structured to serve mission-first programs through fiscal sponsorship partnerships.  
This structure allows for sustainable growth while protecting the company's integrity and ethical foundations.

Our guiding principles are simple but non-negotiable:

**Trauma-Informed Everything** — Every design, workflow, and policy starts with one question: "What impact will this have on someone in crisis?"

**Transparency and Safety Over Speed** — We don't rush deployment at the cost of privacy or dignity.

**Collaboration Over Competition** — Survivors need networks, not silos. We build systems that connect rather than divide.

---

## Our Approach

**Lockard LLC** operates as a parent company that develops and launches specialized ventures, each addressing specific needs within the survivor and crisis support ecosystem. Rather than building everything under one roof, we create focused companies that can deeply understand and serve their particular communities.

### **Company Structure**
Each project and company under the Lockard LLC umbrella operates as a distinct entity with its own:
- Specialized focus area and target community
- Dedicated team and resources
- Customized technology stack and approach
- Independent development roadmap

### **Current Portfolio**
Our portfolio includes companies and projects in development across various domains:
- **Crisis Support Technology** - AI-powered assistance and resource navigation
- **Trauma-Informed Care** - Veterinary and pet welfare services for survivors
- **Integrated Care Platforms** - Unified systems connecting multiple support services
- **Community Infrastructure** - Tools and platforms for advocacy organizations

*Individual company details and project information will be available in their respective directories as they are developed and launched.*

## Core Principles

Lockard LLC isn't about scale for scale's sake. We measure success by **trust, transparency, and tangible impact** across all our companies and projects.

**Lived-Experience Design**  
Every company and project begins with empathy and ends with clarity. We build tools informed by personal experience, survivor feedback, and trauma psychology — not guesswork.

**Ethical Infrastructure**  
Data privacy, security, and informed consent are non-negotiable across all ventures. Our systems are auditable, transparent, and designed to protect users even in high-risk situations.

**Trauma-Informed UX**  
We design calm, focused interfaces for people under stress. Clarity replaces noise; compassion replaces friction in every product we develop.

**Community Partnership**  
We co-develop with shelters, legal aid teams, social service agencies, and advocacy partners — because solving real problems means building with the community, not for it.

**Purposeful Incubation**  
Each company we develop serves a specific, well-defined need within the survivor support ecosystem, ensuring focused impact rather than diluted efforts.

### **Brand and Identity**

The Lockard brand represents both vulnerability and strength — a bridge between pain and progress.  
Our tone is professional but human, built to invite trust from survivors, partners, and funders alike.  
The logo, colors, and messaging are grounded in calmness, precision, and accessibility — visual proof that empathy and design excellence can coexist.

Every project we take on — from ethical infrastructure development to human-centered AI design — aligns with one mission: to make stability accessible, not conditional.

## Technical Overview

This repository hosts Lockard LLC's parent company web presence, documentation portal, and backend infrastructure.  
It serves as the central hub for information about our umbrella organization and provides the foundation for individual company directories as they are developed.

```

### Individual Company Structure
As companies are developed, each will have its own directory with:
- Independent documentation and README files
- Company-specific assets and branding
- Dedicated development workflows
- Custom Firebase configurations (if needed)

### Firebase Configuration

1. Copy `firebase/config.template.js` → `firebase/config.js`  
2. Add your Firebase Web App credentials (Console → Project Settings → General)  
3. Confirm `window.__FIREBASE_CONFIG__` matches your environment  
4. Run `yarn dev` to preview locally with Firebase emulators  
5. Deploy with `yarn deploy` or `yarn deploy:all` (site + config updates)

Keep `config.template.js` untouched to preserve contributor clarity.  
When rotating credentials, update and redeploy without exposing sensitive data.

---

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+  
- Yarn package manager  
- Firebase CLI (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)

### Commands

```bash
yarn install      # Install dependencies
yarn dev          # Run local server with Firebase emulators
yarn deploy       # Deploy production site
yarn deploy:all   # Deploy site + Firebase configurations
````

### Workflow

1. Branch from `main` (e.g., `feature/care-platform`, `update/docs`)
2. Test locally with `yarn dev`
3. Validate responsiveness, accessibility, and error-free builds
4. Submit a pull request with clear notes
5. Merge after review and deploy to production

## Why It Matters

Lockard LLC is more than a company — it's a personal declaration of survival turned systemic redesign.
Every system that once failed me now informs what we build across all our ventures, ensuring others don't face the same isolation, fear, or uncertainty.

For over a decade, I lived under the control of someone who weaponized isolation, addiction, and dependency. I understand intimately how hard it is to navigate those systems — filing protection orders, accessing trauma-informed medical care, finding safe housing — none of it is built for people in crisis.

That's why I created Lockard LLC: to build the tools I wish had existed when I was trapped in those moments.

Technology cannot erase trauma — but it can make recovery navigable, accessible, and dignified.
That is what we build for, across every company and project we develop.

By creating focused, specialized companies rather than trying to solve everything under one roof, we can ensure that each venture deeply understands and serves its specific community, leading to more meaningful impact and sustainable solutions.

Lockard LLC isn't just my company — it's the architecture of my recovery, and the framework through which I help others rebuild theirs.
