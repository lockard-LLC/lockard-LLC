## Phone opener (30s)

“Hi Dr. [Name], this is Shawn with PetPass in Lexington. We coordinate basic visits and pay the discounted invoice net‑15. Pilot ask is small: 30% discount and 1–2 weekly slots. Patients arrive with a Case‑ID voucher—no personal details. Can I email a one‑pager and schedule 10 minutes?”

### Initial email

**Subject:** Partnering to keep families + pets together (PetPass pilot)  
[Body similar to toolkit; bullet asks; 15‑min call CTA]

### Confirmation email (clinic)

**Subject:** Community visit — Case [CASE_ID]  
Scope; cap/expiry; discount; preferred times; invoice net‑15; Case ID only.

### Follow‑up (no reply)

**Subject:** Quick follow‑up — PetPass pilot  
Checking in; offer times; one‑pager attached.

### Invoice mismatch

**Subject:** Invoice check — Case [CASE_ID]  
We compute net $[EXPECTED]; your invoice shows $[NET]. Confirm discount & co‑pay lines?

### Decline template

Thanks for considering. We’ll reach back post‑pilot or if capacity changes.
