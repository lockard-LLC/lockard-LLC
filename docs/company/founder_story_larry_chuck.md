## Founder Story — Jerry & Larry

Jerry left an abusive relationship. During that period, rabbit **Larry** developed a sudden head tilt (possible vestibular disease). In the scramble to find care, sliding‑scale and DV‑safe options were scarce; no one could help quickly without separating Jerry from Larry.

That gap—**affordable, fast, privacy‑respecting veterinary access without forced separation**—is why PetPass exists. PetPass arranges discounted basic/urgent visits with partner clinics, uses **case IDs** (no names on clinic paperwork), and pays invoices **net‑15**. The initial pilot in **Lexington, KY** is deliberately tiny: 1 clinic, **3 vouchers**, **$100 cap**, **30% clinic discount**, **$0–$10 co‑pay**.

**Larry recovered.** The program is designed so more families don’t have to choose between safety and staying with their animals.

## Today’s translation of that story

- **PetPass (petpass.help):** public UI that keeps survivor data minimal, powered by the shared backend so clinics only see case IDs.
- **Lockard Admin Portal (admin.lockard.llc):** the place where staff manage vouchers, onboarding, Firebase configs, and narrative assets about Jerry, Larry, and Chuck. The calm, glassy UI reinforces safety and control.
- **Shared design tokens:** the “quiet tech” palette, glass layers, and motion specs help every Lockard surface quietly signal care and precision—mirroring the deliberate calm that Larry and Chuck needed.

The founder story isn’t just history; it drives every architectural decision: no duplicated secrets, no noisy UI, and always a fast path from intake to care without exposing survivors.
