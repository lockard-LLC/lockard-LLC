# Kentucky Charitable Solicitation — Notes

**Owner:** Jerry • **Visibility:** Internal

When operating under a **fiscal sponsor**, the sponsor typically handles registrations and receipts.  
Avoid public “donation” asks in Lockard LLC’s name without sponsor context.  
Use language: “Donations processed by [Sponsor], a 501(c)(3), restricted to PetPass.”  
Confirm with sponsor’s counsel before multi‑state fundraising.
