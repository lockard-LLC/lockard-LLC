## Fiscal Sponsorship (Model C) — Pitch & FAQ

**What is fiscal sponsorship?**
A 501(c)(3) **sponsor** receives tax‑deductible donations/grants restricted to the **PetPass** program, and contracts with **Lockard LLC** to deliver services at market rates.

**Why Model C?**

* Start quickly without forming a new nonprofit.
* Accept grants/donations today; maintain quality control and reporting.
* Keep IP and tech development within Lockard LLC.

**What do we need from a sponsor?**

* Restricted fund for PetPass; standard financial controls.
* Services agreement for Lockard LLC (scope, deliverables, rates).
* Reporting cadence (monthly pilot report + annual summary).
* Visibility/acknowledgment terms.

**Typical admin fee range?**

* Often **5–15%** of restricted revenues (varies by sponsor and risk).

**How does invoicing work?**

* Sponsor pays clinics (or reimburses PetPass) under the restricted fund.
* Lockard LLC invoices sponsor for operational services.

**What about compliance?**

* Sponsor handles charitable solicitation registration where needed.
* PetPass follows privacy/safety policies; Case IDs only on clinic docs.

**Can sponsors exit?**

* Yes; include 30‑day termination and data transition terms.
