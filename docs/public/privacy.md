## PetPass — Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how **Lockard LLC** ("we", "us") collects, uses, and safeguards information for **PetPass** at **petpass.help**, the company sites at **lockard.llc**, and staff tools at **admin.lockard.llc**.

## Summary

* **Minimal data.** We collect only what is needed to coordinate a veterinary visit.
* **Case IDs to clinics.** We use Case IDs instead of names on clinic-facing documents.
* **Short retention.** We purge personally identifying information (PII) **90 days** after case closure. Financial records retain Case ID only for **7 years**.

## Information We Collect

* **Contact details (optional):** name/alias, email, phone, and preferred/safe contact method.
* **Case details:** species, concern (free text), ZIP code.
* **Operational data:** appointment status, voucher cap/expiry, invoice line items (with Case ID only).
* **Website analytics:** basic usage data (e.g., pages viewed) with IP address truncated/anonymized where supported. We do **not** sell personal information.

## How We Use Information

* Coordinate intake → voucher → clinic scheduling.
* Communicate via the **safest contact channel** you select.
* Reconcile invoices and track program metrics.
* Maintain security, prevent misuse, and improve the service.

## What We Share

* **Clinics:** Case ID, voucher details (cap/expiry), and scope of visit. We avoid sharing names or contact details with clinics unless you explicitly ask.
* **Vendors:** Limited service providers (e.g., email, file storage) under confidentiality and data-protection obligations.
* **Legal:** If required by law or to prevent harm.

## Retention

* **Active cases:** information needed to deliver care.
* **Closed cases:** PII removed after **90 days**; finance records with **Case ID only** kept **7 years**.
* **Backups:** encrypted; destroyed per schedule. `data/server` enforces retention automatically where possible.

## Cookies & Analytics

We use essential cookies only. If analytics are enabled, we configure them to minimize data and respect browser privacy features.

## Your Choices

* Request access or deletion of your information (subject to legal requirements).
* Choose the safest contact method; request that we do not leave voicemail or texts.

## Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards, including access controls, encryption in transit, and least-privilege file permissions.

## Children’s Privacy

PetPass is not directed to children under 13. If we learn we have collected such information, we will delete it.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this notice. The "Effective" date reflects the latest revision.
