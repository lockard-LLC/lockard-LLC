## PetPass — Terms of Use

These Terms govern your use of **petpass.help** and participation in the PetPass program.

## 1. Program Scope and No Medical Advice

PetPass coordinates discounted veterinary appointments with partner clinics. We do not provide medical advice. Decisions about diagnosis and treatment are made by licensed veterinarians.

## 2. Eligibility and Availability

Pilot availability is limited (Lexington, KY). We may decline or waitlist cases when capacity is reached or outside scope (e.g., imaging/surgery) without pre-approval.

## 3. Case IDs and Privacy

We use **Case IDs** on clinic-facing documents to protect privacy. You are responsible for providing a safe contact method and telling us whether voicemail or texts are safe. Backend systems (`data/server`) store only the data needed to coordinate care; see the Privacy Notice for more details.

## 3.1 Staff Portal & Admin Tools

Authorized staff access additional tooling at **admin.lockard.llc**. These tools are restricted to Lockard personnel and subject to internal policies; misuse will result in termination of access.

## 4. Vouchers and Payments

Vouchers specify a spending cap and expiry. Partner clinics apply a discount to eligible services. You may have a small co-pay. PetPass pays the clinic’s discounted invoice **net‑15** for approved services.

## 5. No Emergency Service

PetPass is not an emergency service. If you believe you or your animal is in danger, contact local emergency services or an emergency veterinary clinic.

## 6. Third‑Party Clinics

Clinics are independent third parties. We are not responsible for their acts, omissions, pricing beyond agreed discounts, or outcomes of care.

## 7. Acceptable Use

Do not misuse the site or program (e.g., by submitting false information, attempting to interfere with operations, or violating others’ rights).

## 8. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

The service is provided "as is" without warranties. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Lockard LLC is not liable for indirect or consequential damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; rights may vary.

## 9. Changes to the Service

We may modify or discontinue features or the pilot at any time, with or without notice.

## 10. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the **Commonwealth of Kentucky**.
