## Role — Shawn Kelly, Vet Outreach Coordinator (VOC)

## Public Bio (for clinics)

* **Name:** Shawn Kelly
* **Role:** Vet Outreach Coordinator (PetPass)
* **Email:** [skelly@lockard.llc](mailto:skelly@lockard.llc) (company) / [skelly@petpass.help](mailto:skelly@petpass.help) (PetPass program)
* **Phone:** [Google Voice TBD]
* **Hours (pilot):** Weekdays, daytime (ET)

## Core Mission (internal)

Run day‑to‑day operations so survivors keep pets with them—on time, within budget, with strict privacy.

## Decision Rights

* **Can do (no approval):** approve vouchers ≤ $100; confirm **30% discount** + **1–2 weekly slots**; draft/send clinic & survivor comms; negotiate/reschedule; reconcile invoices; queue **net‑15**; close cases and send thanks.
* **Escalate to CEO:** discount < 30%; voucher > $100 or > 2 visits/90 days; imaging/surgery/specialty referral; **any safety/privacy concern**.

## Daily (60–90 minutes)

* Inbox sweep → intakes, clinic replies, invoices.
* Triage → urgency, clinic proposal, **Case ID** assignment.
* Vouchers → generate, email clinic, log in ledger.
* Schedule → lock appointment; confirm neutrally with survivor.
* Invoices → math check; queue **net‑15**.

## Weekly / Monthly

* Weekly: clinic check‑in; update metrics; export backups; purge PII as per policy.
* Monthly: 1‑page pilot report (cases, time‑to‑appointment, cost/case, satisfaction; wins/risks/anecdotes).

## Tools & Access

Email ([skelly@lockard.llc](mailto:skelly@lockard.llc) + [skelly@petpass.help](mailto:skelly@petpass.help)), Google Voice, Google Sheets (ledger), secure invoice storage, voucher PDF generator, calendar access; password manager + 2FA; access to `admin.lockard.llc` (Training + Tools modules) and the PetPass employee portal once live.

## Portal expectations

- Keep onboarding modules current: update lesson copy whenever scripts, forms, or policies change.
- File daily checklist notes under Training → Daily Ops; sync blockers into docs + memory at session end.
- Use the command palette (`⌘K`/`Ctrl+K`) to jump between tools instead of bookmarking raw URLs—this guarantees you stay inside the secured portal context backed by `data/server`.
