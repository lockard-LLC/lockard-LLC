# Code of Conduct & Non‑Discrimination

**Owner:** Jerry • **Visibility:** Public

Respect & dignity; zero harassment; no discrimination; trauma‑informed communication; report channels; anti‑retaliation; enforcement steps.

## Practical expectations

- All staff interactions (Slack, email, portal comments) follow neutral, trauma-informed language. We never joke about survivors, clinics, or partners.
- Accessibility is non-negotiable: when creating docs or UI, follow WCAG 2.2 AA and the shared design tokens.
- Privacy always wins: use case IDs, avoid sharing names, and report any suspected leak instantly.
- Report channels: direct to Jerry via Signal/phone/email; escalate in writing if needed. Retaliation is zero-tolerance.

## Enforcement

1. Document the incident (date, channel, people involved) and notify Jerry.
2. Immediate review → potential suspension of access (admin portal, repos, email).
3. Written remediation plan or termination, depending on severity.
