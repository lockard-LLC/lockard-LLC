## 2025 focus

- Approve and narrate the Lockard Admin Portal experience (glass UI, tokens, motion specs) so staff and contractors stay aligned.
- Maintain source-of-truth decisions on Firebase project access (landing/admin vs PetPass) and ensure `data/server` remains the only privileged backend.
- Review bundle/memory updates weekly to keep Codex aligned with company priorities.
- Champion documentation hygiene: every structural change must land in memory + `docs/**` with a matching changelog entry.
