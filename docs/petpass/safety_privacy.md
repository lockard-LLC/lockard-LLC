## PetPass — Safety & Privacy Policy (Pilot)

## Summary (Public)

* **Case IDs only.** Clinics see a Case ID (e.g., `PP-LEX-2511-0001`), not names.
* **Neutral language.** We avoid “DV/abuse” in all clinic-facing comms; we use “community program”.
* **Data minimization.** We store only what’s necessary; contact info is kept separate from billing.
* **Survivor choice.** We use the **safest contact channel** confirmed by the survivor.

## Staff Appendix (Internal)

### 1) Core Rules

1. **Clinic-facing identifiers:** Case ID only. Never put survivor names on invoices or emails to clinics; `data/server` enforces this rule.
2. **Subject lines:** Use neutral phrasing: *“Community visit — Case PP‑LEX‑2511‑0001”*.
3. **Safe comms:** Confirm safe channel (email/text/call). Do **not** leave voicemail/text unless explicitly allowed.
4. **Need-to-know:** Share the minimum necessary. Keep contact info in a separate, access-controlled store.
5. **Screenshots/attachments:** Redact names/addresses before sharing in tickets or emails.

### 2) Intake Safety Checklist (must confirm)

* [ ] Safe contact method (email/text/call) and voicemail/text preferences
* [ ] Neutral subject lines; neutral caller ID
* [ ] No assumptions about device safety; confirm
* [ ] Timing restrictions captured (e.g., contact only 9–5)
* [ ] Recipient verified before any case details

### 3) Data Retention

* **Active cases:** retain data required to deliver care.
* **Closed cases:** purge PII after **90 days**; keep financial records for **7 years** with Case ID only.
* **Backups:** weekly encrypted backups; destroy per schedule.

### 4) Clinic Confidentiality (minimum)

* Invoice with **Case ID only** (no names).
* Discreet front-desk handling; no public announcements of affiliation.
* Staff trained on trauma-informed basics; neutral language in all messages.

### 5) Incident Response (privacy/safety)

1. **Pause** all comms on the case.
2. **Record**: what happened, when, to whom.
3. **Escalate** immediately to CEO (Jerry).
4. **Do not** contact survivor/clinic again until guided.
5. Follow the separate **Incident Response Runbook**.
