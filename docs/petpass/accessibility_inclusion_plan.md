# Accessibility & Inclusion Plan (PetPass)

**Owner:** Jerry • **Visibility:** Public

**Standards:** WCAG 2.2 AA.  
**Language:** neutral, plain language; survivor‑centric; translated short pages (as capacity allows).  
**Design:** high contrast; keyboard support; skip links; reduced motion; label inputs; error text helpful.  
**Process:** quarterly audits; fix SLAs by severity; admin + employee portals share the same tokens + motion rules so reduced-motion preferences propagate everywhere.
